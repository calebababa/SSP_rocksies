SSP rocksies-borehole logs

<br>

<b>This project aims to bring the tabulated but scattered borehole repository within SSP Geotechnics into a digital framework.</b><br>
* This will eventually allow users to navigate around Malaysia with their mouse. 
* An interactive GUI will show the ground profiles of the selected borehole points. 
* These information can be downloaded into a .pdf or .xls format for further use in the user's machines. 

<b>Terms of use:</b>
This repository is currently public and will remain so until it is complete. Until the time arrives for it to be used solely by the registered staffs of SSP S/B, feel free to add your input in the <b>comments and feedback</b> section or email caleb.sang@sspsb.com.my
